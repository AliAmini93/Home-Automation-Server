# Home Automation Server
In the BSc thesis, a server was constructed for Home Automation. in this project, two distinct types of electrical circuits were designed for the client and server. The client's electrical system was equipped with a temperature and light meter. Using transceiver modules, this circuit relayed the data to the server remotely. On the other hand, the server electrical circuit could receive the information from clients and send them in Bluetooth protocol to the mobile phone.

In this project, the cellphone was responsible for collecting the data from the server circuit. Finally, a mobile application for Android was created to display client information.
